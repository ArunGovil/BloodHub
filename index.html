            Blood is one of the most important components of the human body. Although
            most countries actively participate in Blood donation campaigns and activities, 
            still in many cases most of them lack providing enough units of blood as compared 
            to the required amount.Â 
            
            As a consequence, our team has decided to create an essential mobile application
            to solve this challenge in our College. The motive of the app is to
            eradicate the dearth of blood units in our locality.
